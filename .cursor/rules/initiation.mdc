**Things to consider**
- Break down the task into multiple steps.
- Include the branch creation step at first.
- Tell me if I'm going in the wrong direction.
- Tell me how much you understood the instruction, and find potential problems.
- Feel free to ask questions.
- Don't implement anything before I approve.
